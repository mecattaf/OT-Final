## Question 1:

The three mechanisms of Organiational Homogeneity as DiMagigo and Powell describe them:
- Coercive isomorphism
When the organization is subjected to formal and informal pressures, that either other organizations or societal expectations exert. This may be through new laws or regulations, or more generally some societal norm. Organizations will be compelled to conform and abide by these at the fear of facing negative repercussions.
A simple example here could be the GDRP data privacy that companies that have to comply with, at the risk of eing fined. Or perhaps the carbon tax that is being imposed on certain industries, which have changed their incentives to be more ESG-compliant.

- Mimetic isomorphism
As time goes by in a given field, we witness the emergence of certain best practices (formalized or semi-formalized). The more uncertain or "new" the environment is (new industry, reacting for example to technological innovation). Other organizations will become aware of these best practices done by their competitors and try to imitate or copy their winning strategy as a means to try to gain more legitimacy r reduce risk.
One field where this has happened a lot recently is the rise of big data analytics in world Soccer - specifically in the British Premier League. Five years ago only a few of the biggest teams (pioneered by Manchester City and Arsenal FC) employed 2-3 data scientists, who would conduct in-depth analyses on a weekly basis for each of their opponent to gain the edge. The invented heuristics to measure player performance over time beyond only goals scored: the most popular of which is "xGoals" or "expected goals". Fast-forward to now and we note that every single premier league football team employs huge teams of data scientists. And in fact even sports commentators on TV speak about the xGoals factor when analyzing the games.

- Normative isomorphism
stems frm profesionalizatoin and the influence of professional netoworks and associations. as professions establish standards and norms, organizaitons adapt to align wihth these expectations
In class we used Bocconi as an institution as an illustration of this. For example for the MBA program, SDA was able to gain a tremendous ranking boost in a few years by "conforming" and adopting the behaviors that lead to the US News and other third-party ranking providers. Similarly for the track to becoming a full professor, it was noted that the specific number of required papers for publication has 

These three forms of isomorphisms challenge the notion that organizations are purely rational actors: their rationality is "collective" - also known in layman terms as "Herd Mentality". Organizations exist in an environment, not in a vacuum. Individual actors within this organization may observe what others are doing and try to do the same: there is a socio-cultural context that this paper was one of the first to introduce. 
Another challenge to the notion that organizations are "purely rational actors" is that while the phenomenon of isomorphism may lead to an improvement in the short-term survival of the organization, this may harm them in the long run because their it increases their "fragility". This is the equivalent of a person smoking cigarettes because their friends group contains smokers, despite knowing it causes cancer - something they would not indulge in if they were indeed purely rational.

## Question 2:

#### (a) The conditions that lead to market failure:

My answer to the first part of this question will draw from the concepts seen in the Ouchi "Markets, Bureaucracies and Clans" paper. In a world where we have pure market control as a mechanism to regulate the organization, the primary drivers for behavior are competition and pricing mechanisms.

Transaction costs emerge when there is lack of trust: an underlying assumption of TCE is that actors are opportunistic. Note that this is true both within and betwen firms (the two units of analysis are relevant). Market failure occurs when the members are not effective at cooperating or coordinating amongst themselves, causing inefficiencies and the need for control. This can even undo the benefits market control brings: decentralization and adaptability, and on the contrary become a force for centralization and rigidity in the rules. Thus bureaucratic control emerges when there is an abundance of standardized processes and hierarchy. As an aside, clan control relies on social relationships and makes it so that each member have a deep sense of belonging.

#### (b) Impact of the Evolution of digital technologies in modern organizations:

Transaction Cost Economics sees the environment as a set of external constraints. It is also explained that organizations themselves tend to be stable unless market forces shift. The Ouchi paper mentioned previously does not prescribe that a mode of control is better or worse (in terms of effectiveness) compared the others: it depends on the goals and circumstances of the organization. Will the evolution of digital technologies tip the balance towards more Bureaucratic Governance? This can arguably be classified as an extreme shift in the market forces. 

New technologies are changing the very fabric of the organization: the same level of productivity will be attainable with much smaller organizations. Thus the barriers to entry - or technical competitive advantage - for an organization is lower than ever: smaller players can compete with huge organizations despite having far less resources than them.
I give the example of large software engineering teams: typically relying on a project owner or manager who distributes the tasks and oversees timely completion, "junior" engineers tasked with writing the code according to specification and "senior" engineers who may work on crucial parts of the code base and most importantly review/modify/improve the code written by junior developers before merging the changes- which ensures that there are no vulnerabilities introduced in the product or codebase. 
Digital technologies now automate a large portion of the tasks described above as "low-level" (or "entry level" ie. things that do not require a lot of real-world experience to do). Very few if any junior engineers will be required as Artificial Intelligence Large Language Models can produce code that is consistent with the required standards of the organization. This empowers the senior developer tremendously as they can do more in less time, and rely less on other people. Similarly on the nontechnical side: product managers 
There is simply less people to organize! By this logic hierarchies themselves would flatten.

If we extrapolate this scenario to the extreme, what may arise is the organization as we know it "dematerializes" itself, leaving disjointed actors who are very good at what they do but who are repleable with others. A popular quote from OpenAI Founder and CEO SAM Altman emerged in the past few months, suggesting that "We will see a one-person company generating a billion dollars of revenue soon" (somthing along those lines). In other words there could very well be "nobody to organize": the human decision maker instructs a swarm of AI Agents who do not have incentive to lie or work opportunistically.

These arguments would lead me to believe that we digital technologies - primarily artificial intelligence - will challenge market failure, moving away from structure/hierarchy and more towards agency.
